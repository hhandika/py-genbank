Automate fasta file preparation of Sanger sequencing data for GenBank submission 

This script is designed to format fasta input file for GenBank submission. The original script was written by Dr. Jacob A. Esselstyn. I modified it to make it more robust. 

## State of Code
Work in progress. Currently, it is working as expected. It is only accept one nexus file as an input. I am working on expanding its the capability to accept multiple files in both fasta and nexus format as inputs. Hence, you should expect significant refactoring and re-structuring in this repo.
