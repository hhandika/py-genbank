Automate sequence preparation for GenBank submission

This script is designed to format fasta input file for GenBank submission. The original script was written by Dr. Jacob A. Esselstyn. I modified it to make it more robust. 

## State of Code
Work in progress. Currently, it is working as expected. It is only accept one nexus file as an input. I am working on expanding its the capability to accept multiple files as well as different both fasta and nexus files as inputs and and provide statistics of the resulting files.
